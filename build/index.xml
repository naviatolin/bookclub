      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-book&#34;&gt;First Book!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will be reading Molly by Blake Butler for the first book! So excited to read together! And to set the scene, this is a heavier book that unfortunately has a lot of cultural context (Molly also wrote a book about her upbringing, Blake has Twitter, ugh). Feel free to bring that extra context to the discussion!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;logistics-yap&#34;&gt;Logistics Yap!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This first book was obviously not voted on, but so excited to read together and hear everyone&amp;rsquo;s thoughts! I&amp;rsquo;ll be creating a group chat over text for everyone who expressed interested in being a part of book club generally, and will be taking headcount for June over there! We can all decide on location, time, etc. for our first meeting together!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
