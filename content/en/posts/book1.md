<!-- introduction -->
## First Book!
We will be reading Molly by Blake Butler for the first book! So excited to read together! And to set the scene, this is a heavier book that unfortunately has a lot of cultural context (Molly also wrote a book about her upbringing, Blake has Twitter, ugh). Feel free to bring that extra context to the discussion!

## Logistics Yap!
This first book was obviously not voted on, but so excited to read together and hear everyone's thoughts! I'll be creating a group chat over text for everyone who expressed interested in being a part of book club generally, and will be taking headcount for June over there! We can all decide on location, time, etc. for our first meeting together!
<!--more-->
Just so you know what to expect for coming months: a little before we meet, I'll ask folks who are interested in participating the next month to suggest a book. Then we will vote between them! Trying to keep this as democratic as possible.
## First Meeting Vibes!
Please bring the best vibesâ€”would love folks to be open to hearing each other out and not talk over each other/argue! Really an open, kind, and judgment free space with bomb snacks. If the group feels too big, and people can't get a word in, we can break into smaller groups and come back together or something. **Feel free to offer suggestions live always!** I want this to be as enjoyable for people as possible.
